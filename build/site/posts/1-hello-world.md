<p>
       This is the very first post on this personal blog.
       Probably most inresting its created using the Haskell site generator 
       <a href="https://github.com/ChrisPenner/slick"> Slick </a>
       
       Arguably, it might be a bit of overengineering for a simple blog, but at least I can say Iâ€™ve built something useful using Haskell :)
