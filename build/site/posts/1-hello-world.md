Some technical info as my first post:

- Uses Haskell site generator [Slick](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/slick)

- Supports [Mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/) Markdown extensions

- The site background comes from [Hero Patterns](https://heropatterns.com/)

Arguably, it might be a bit of overengineering for a simple blog to use Haskell.

But at least I can get some programmer cred :)
