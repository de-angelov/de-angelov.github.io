## GNOME Extensions

**[Blur My Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/)** – Adds blur and transparency effects to the top bar, dash, notifications, and overview for a sleek “frosted glass” look.  

**[Dash To Panel](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/)** – Combines GNOME’s dash and top bar into a single taskbar, showing running apps, launchers, system indicators, and window previews.

**[Forge](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4481/forge/)** – A tiling and window-management extension that provides dynamic tiling layouts, split containers, floating mode, and keyboard-driven window navigation.

## Browsers

**[Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)** – Chromium with all Google-specific web services and background requests stripped out.

---

## Terminal / CLI

**[micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/)** – My "normie" terminal text editor. It feels like a standard GUI app (standard `Ctrl` shortcuts, mouse support) but lives in the shell.

**[k9s](https://k9scli.io/)** – Great TUI utility for k8s. Makes navigating clusters and checking logs significantly faster than manual `kubectl` commands.

**[tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/)** - Terminal emulator that follows the Gnome Human Interface Guidelines.

## Design & Graphics

**[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)** – A free, web-based alternative to Photoshop. It handles `.psd` files perfectly and runs entirely in the browser


---


## IDE

**VS Code** – Open-source forks do not support the **Dev Containers** extension

## BONUS 

**[Windows AME (Ameliorated)](https://amelabs.net/)** -
Used for setting up a "clean" machine when I'm forced to use Windows. I use the AME Wizard/Playbooks to strip the OS down to its core. It removes bloat, making Windows feel like it is 7 again.
