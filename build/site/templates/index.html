        I'm <em>Denis Angelov</em>, and welcome to my corner of the digital world.

      <p>
        Inspired by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/">Luke Smith's</a> retro webpage, 
        I've created this simple site as my digital notebook and public "second brain" for some useful stuff.

      <h4>A bit about me: </h2>

      <p>
        I'm from Bulgaria and currently work as a software developer, 
        although I actually have a degree in architecture and spent a few years in that field.
