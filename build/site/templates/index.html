        <h4>A bit about me:</h4>
      <p>
      My name is <em>Denis Angelov</em> and nice to meet you.
      </br>
      I live in Sofia, Bulgaria.Although I currently work in tech,
      </br>
      I have a degree in architecture and spent several years in that field before moving into software development.
      </br>
      In my free time, I enjoy practicing martial arts, traveling, and creating personal websites, something you may have noticed here.

        <h4>A bit about this page:</h4>

        <p>
          Inspired by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/">Luke Smith's</a> retro website, 
          I've created this one as my digital corner of the internet, something in between a notebook and public "second brain" for useful insights and notes.
          I plan to tweak and upgrade existing articles  in the blog section regularly.
